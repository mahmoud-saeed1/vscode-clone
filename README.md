## Introduction 📜

The VS Code Clone is designed to replicate the familiar file explorer interface of Visual Studio Code. This project focuses on leveraging modern web technologies to achieve a dynamic and interactive user experience. It also highlights the usage of Redux Toolkit to manage application state efficiently and demonstrates recursion for handling hierarchical data like file trees. Dive in to explore its features and code structure! 💪

## Features ✨

- **File Explorer:**
  - Create, read, and manage files and folders in a hierarchical structure.
  - Add new files or folders dynamically with validation.
  - Toggle between opened files and preview their content seamlessly.

- **Interactive Panels:**
  - Resizable panels for enhanced UI flexibility.
  - Smooth transitions and animations powered by Tailwind CSS.

- **State Management:**
  - Implemented with Redux Toolkit for scalable state management.
  - Demonstrates advanced patterns using slices and actions.

- **Recursion in UI:**
  - Utilizes recursion to render nested file structures dynamically.

- **Custom Components:**
  - Context menus for file operations.
  - File icons that adapt based on file type and state.

- **Accessibility & Performance:**
  - Built with accessibility in mind to ensure an inclusive experience.
  - High-performance UI leveraging Vite and optimized React rendering.
